## 👀 About Me:

After 6 years working as HR Business Partner, including HRBP for Tech teams, I decided to reorientate my career and start a training to become a Software Developer. So here I am, learning to become a Software Developer at Ada Tech School (Paris, France)!

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:

The 9-months full-time period at school is now over, and I started my apprenticeship as an iOS developer at Back Market (yay!) on September 5th. I keep practising Swift and SwiftUI on my personal time by building an Animal Crossing App, which aims to help having an inventory of fish, bugs, deep sea animals, and artcrafts you can get in the game.

## 📝 At school:

Ada Tech School is a 9 months program followed by a one-year apprenticeship. During the 9 months, we have both theory phases (but still full of practice, exercises and challenges) and group project phases (every project lasts 2 weeks). So far, we have been working on a PICO-8 game (LUA), a Data Vizualisation project (Javascript), a Chrome Web Extension (Javascript), a Social Network (PHP, MySQL), a furniture sales platform (React, Django), a microblogging platform (PHP Laravel), and a Mobile project (both in Front - SwiftUI -  and in Back - Go).

## 🤩 What I like (apart from coding 😇):

I love everything related to Pokemon, building Legos, playing video games (like Horizons Forbidden West 💚), karaoke with friends, reading, exercising...
