👀 ##About Me:

After 6 years working as HR Business Partner, including HRBP for Tech teams, I decided to reorientate my career and start a training to become a Software Developer. So here I am, learning to become a Software Developer at Ada Tech School (Paris, France)!

🌱 ##I’m currently learning:

Apart from my time at school, I'm also following courses on React and on Swift. As a future personal project, I would like to create a Quizz App with Swift. TBC!

📝 ##At school:

Ada Tech School is a 9 months program followed by a one-year apprenticeship. During the 9 months, we have both theory phases (but still full of practice, exercises and challenges) and group project phases (every project lasts 2 weeks). So far, we have been working on a PICO-8 game (LUA), a Data Vizualisation project (Javascript), a Chrome Web Extension (Javascript), a Social Network (PHP, MySQL), and a furniture sales platform (React, Django). In the future, we'll also work on a microblogging platform, and a Mobile project (both in Front and in Back).

🤩 ##What I like (apart from coding 😇):

I love everything related to Pokemon, building Legos, playing video games (like Horizons Forbidden West 💚), karaoke with friends, reading, exercising...
